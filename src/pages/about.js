        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Lara and I'm an under construction developer.</p>
        
        <p>I come from beautiful, sunny Split, Croatia, but currently living in Berlin. I've been working as a IT Support Engineer / Project Manager for the past 10ish years and decided it was the right time to change my career path and embark on the web dev journey.<span role="img" aria-label="programmer emoji">👩‍💻</span></p>
        
        <p>I started following The Odin Project Foundations path and after that path is finished I'll continue with the TOP JavaScript path and Full Stack Open path.</p>
        
        <p>I'm learning Gatsby + Contentful at the moment to build this portfolio + blog site and couldn't be more excited about the process.</p>
